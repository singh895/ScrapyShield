Provide some information about the literature that you used to develop your project. Aim for a handful of paragraphs. 
Don't go too hard. 
If this is taking more than half a page (1-column), you're doing too much.

This is a building project, so making sure that you provide a relationship between the work that you're doing and the topics from the class that's the most important part of this section.
I'm adding one citation of an academic article here~\cite{dong2023behind} and a website here~\cite{least-weird-forum-user} so you know how citations look like.

\subsection{Project Goals}

Please outline what exactly are you building.
This is probably easy if for example you have a good description of the GitHub issue or so.
Please be as explicit as possible, don't aim to say too much.
For example, if the task was ``we basically had to figure out where to put this one line of code but hoo boy was it hard'' that's great --- tell me that.
