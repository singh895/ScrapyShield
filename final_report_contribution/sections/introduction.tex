This section should include a broader overview of the work. All in all, spend a
bit more time covering the elements of the abstract, and outline the work in a bit more depth.

An introduction should help me understand what you did, why you did it the way
you did, and why do you think the work is \emph{sound}.

This section should probably be half a page to $\frac{3}{4}$ of a page.
