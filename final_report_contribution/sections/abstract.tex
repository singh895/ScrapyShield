Abstract goes here.

Please give an overview of the project, do make sure you include the following:
1) What is the problem statement, why does this matter? (I recommend 1 paragraph here)
2) Provide a view of the insight (e.g., we can do x to obtain a yy benefit, or we can measure i to understand j better) 
3) Close with a bit of an overview of the results (e.g., our methods outperform the state of the art by XX\%)
