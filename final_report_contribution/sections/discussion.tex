A discussion section is usually a place where you explore further implications of your work.
Take, for example, the findings could have implications about other work.

\subsection{Implementation challenges}
Tell me if someting you did didn't go your way.
Here you can convince me that there were unforseen circumstances, and whether you adjusted in the best way possible.
For example, you were trying to implement this using library X but library X isn't compatible with the codebase you were working with.

\subsection{Alternative Approaches}
This is also good place to talk about why what you did didn't work, as well as other approaches you tried and why they didn't work.

\subsection{Community Interactions}
If you spoke with OSS contributors, I recommend spending 1-2 paragraphs here outlining the interaction. Did you learn something? was it easy? hard? do you think they will take your contribution if we gave it more months? did they already take it?
